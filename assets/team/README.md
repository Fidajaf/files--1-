# Team Photos Setup Guide

## Required Images

Please add the following team member photos to this directory:

1. **shemil-siyad.jpg** - Shemil Siyad (Founder & CEO)
2. **kiran-das.jpg** - Kiran Das (Co-Founder)
3. **nihal-pk.jpg** - Nihal Pk (Client Relations)
4. **pravin-s.jpg** - Pravin S (Operations Head)
5. **nidhin-raj.jpg** - Nidhin Raj (Coordination Manager)

## Image Requirements

- **Format**: JPG, JPEG, or PNG
- **Size**: Minimum 256x256 pixels (recommended: 512x512 pixels)
- **Aspect Ratio**: Square (1:1) for best results
- **File Size**: Keep under 500KB for faster loading

## How It Works

- If an image is found, it will be displayed in a circular avatar
- If an image is missing, it will automatically fall back to showing the person's initials (SS, KD, NP, PS, NR) with the gradient background
- Images are automatically cropped to fit the circular frame using `object-cover`

## Adding Your Images

Simply copy your team member photos into this folder with the exact filenames listed above.
